       "- It uses large language models trained on a mixture of public source code, natural language, and other permissively licensed data to learn coding patterns.\n",
       "- When you type, Copilot considers the file content, nearby code, and comments to generate suggestions (single-line completions or multi-line code blocks).\n",
       "- Suggestions are ranked and presented to the user; you can accept, edit, or discard them.\n",
       "- It runs inference in the cloud (or via a hosted service), sending limited context from your editor to the model and returning candidate completions.\n",
