## ISSUES

Need to look into
- codespace auto completing lines of codes. - due to copilot

- to disable copolit - go to extension and disable and reload the window to get changes

- Azure payment plan - could not view since account already created

HOS01  - updated
- opening same codespace for the second time, not a new one
- sync not shown


HOS03 - updated

in Userinput.py
 - use ','  instead of concatenation '+' when printing
 - output screenshot might be different from code


HOS04  - updated
 - sortTuple.py (hos last line instruction unclear)


HOS08 - updated
- screenshot for click on 'Accept offer' button for Azure students to avoid pay

HOS09  - updated
- statements not complete (missing ')' or ',' or ';')
